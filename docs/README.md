# FoldOps Documentation

FoldOps is a Folding@home farm monitor for Debian nodes. Agents on each FAH machine report metrics every 60 seconds to a central supervisor, which stores snapshots in SQLite and serves a React dashboard.

## Quick links

- **Dashboard (production):** `http://fah-01:3000`
- **Supervisor host:** `fah-01`
- **Agent hosts:** `fah-01` through `fah-04`

## Metrics collected

Each agent reports every 60 seconds:

- **System:** uptime, load, CPU %, memory, disk, network, **CPU temperature**, **chassis temperature**
- **FAH:** service status, project/run/clone/gen, progress, PPD, TPF, recent log errors
- **Maintenance:** apt updates available, reboot required

The dashboard shows both temperatures on each machine card. See [Agent — Temperature collection](agent.md#temperature-collection) for sensor sources and troubleshooting.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22+
- Debian with `fah-client` systemd unit
- Build tools for `better-sqlite3` on the supervisor host (`build-essential`, `python3`)
- **Optional:** `lm-sensors` on agent hosts if chassis temperature is not exposed via hwmon alone (see [Installation](installation.md#temperature-sensors-optional))
- **Rust migration:** `rustup` + native dev packages on build hosts only — run `./scripts/check-rust-prereqs.sh` or see [Installation — Rust development prerequisites](installation.md#rust-development-prerequisites)
